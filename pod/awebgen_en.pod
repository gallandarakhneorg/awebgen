AWebGen - Arakhnê Web Generator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

awebgen [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Arakhnê Web Generator, aka. AWebGen, is a offline website generator.
This generator is replacing internal macro commands in a set of files to generate
the HTML website.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--[no]announce>

Send announcement email.

=item B<--[no]autoscript>

Generate or not the PHP scripts predefined in AWebGen.

=item B<-f>

If mirroring is enabled, force AWebGen to upload all the file and not only the changed files.

=item B<--maintenance>

Set the maintenance flag on. Depending on your website style, it could change the look of the generated site.

=item B<--mirror>=I<url>

=item B<--nomirror>

Put or not the generated website on the remote host.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

The configuration directory, here labelled by "config_path" is supposed to be located in the root
directory of the website to generate. By default, the "config_path" is "./.awebgen".

The configuration file is a XML file named "config_path/config".

The configuration file must contains the tag <AWEBGEN />. The following subsections describe
the inner tags.

=head2 Profile Definition

Profiles could be defined according to several contraints. A profile could restrict the configuration
entries.

A profile must be defined in the tag <PROFILES/>. The following example defines a default profil named "home"
and a profile named "work" which is enalbed only if the host IP matches the given network addresses.

<PROFILES>
	<PROFILE name="home" default="yes" />
	<PROFILE name="work">
		<NETWORK ip="10.85.0.99/24" />
	</PROFILE>
</PROFILES>

=head2 Constant Definition

Is is possible to define a set of constant values in AWebGen. These definitions must appear in the <CONSTANTS/> tag.
Each constant pair is defined in a <CONSTANT> tag as followed:

<CONSTANT id="constant_name" value="constant_value" profile="profile_name" />

where the constant_name must be unique. If the profile wad given, the constant will be defined only if
the corresponding profile was enable. If no profile was given, the constant is always defined.

Several constants are recognized and used by AWebGen:

=over 6

=item announce-format indicates if the annoucement emails should use a HTML or a text form. Value must be one of "html" or "text";

=item COPYRIGHT_STRING is expanded to a copyright string "(c) y1-y2 n" where y1 is the first copyright date defined in constant COPYRIGHT_FIRST_YEAR, y2 is the last copyright date (YEAR constant), and n is the copyrighter name (SITE_NAME constant);

=item CSS_FILE is the URL path to the current CSS file;

=item DIFFERED_GENERATOR is an HTML string which is containing the name and the version of AWebGen. This variable will be replaced in the HTML files during the mirroring stage only;

=item EMAIL_CRYPT_KEY is the string which may replace the "at" character (@) when crypting email addresses.

=item GENERATOR is an HTML string which is containing the name and the version of AWebGen. This variable is immediatly replaced in the HTML files;

=item GENERATE_SEND_MESSAGE_SCRIPT is a string containing a boolean value ("true" or "false"). This constant indicates if the sendmessage PHP script will be generated. This constant is automatically set to "true" when CONTACT_FORM is expanded;

=item HIDE_ML_FORM is a boolean value which is used to indicates if the mailing list forms should be displayed or not;

=item HOMES is the directory where the user's home pages are located (by default "${ROOT}/homes");

=item IMG is the directory where images are stored (by default "${ROOT}/images");

=item LAST_CHANGE_DATE is the date of the last change of the page. This variable will be replaced in the HTML files during the mirroring stage only;

=item PAGE_TITLE is the title of the current page;

=item PAGE_COMMENT is the comment associated to the current page;

=item PAGE_KEYWORDS are the keywords associated to the current page;

=item ROOT is the relative path to the root directory;

=item SMTP_SERVER is the IP or the name of the SMTP server used to send announcement emails;

=item SMTP_SENDER is the email which will be used to send annoucement emails;

=item SITE_IMG is the URL path to the site's picture (by default ${IMG}/header.png);

=item SITE_NAME is the name of the website;

=item SITE_URL is the URL of the website;

=item TODAY is the current date and hour in international format.

=item YEAR is the current year in 4 digits.

=back

=head2 Page Definitions

It is possible to define several informations about the website pages in the <PAGES/> tag. Each page
is describes by a individual <PAGE/> tag. The supported attributes of the <PAGE/> tag are:

=over 4

=item I<id> is the unique identifier of the page.

=item I<url> is the path to the HTML page.

=item I<label> is the full name of the page.

=item I<short> is the short name of the page.

=item I<parent> is the identifier of the page which is a parent of this page.

=item I<snap> is the identifier used by the snap.php script to identify the files to download for this page. If the given string starts with "name|", the name is used in place of the first letter of the identifier as the parent directory in the generated link.

=item I<push> is a list of coma-separated identifier of arrays in which the page identifier will be pushed.

=item I<misc> is a list of coma-separated data associated to the page.

=item I<profile> indicates the profile for which the page information are defined.

=back

Example:
	<PAGE id    = "eclipse-subclipse"
              url   = "${ROOT}/eclipse/subclipse/index.html"
              label = "Subclipse: a SVN plugin for Eclipse"
	      short = "Eclipse Subclipse"
	      push  = "othersofts"
	      misc  = "eclipse-subclipse" />

=head2 Ignore Definitions

It is possible to say to AWebGen to ignore several things in the <IGNORES/> tag.

The tag <EXPAND pattern="<pattern>" profile="<profile>" /> permits to avoid AWebGen variable expansions in the file with a name matching the given <pattern> (written as a shell wildcard).

The tag <MIRROR pattern="<pattern>" profile="<profile>" /> permits to avoid AWebGen to upload the files witha name matching the given <pattern> (written as a shell wildcard).

=head2 Mirror Definition

Mirror hosts are used to upload the generated website. It is possible to define a mirror inside the configuration file with:

<MIRROR url="<url>" password="<password>" />

Currently, only FTP connexion are supported by AWebGen.

=head2 Annoucement Definition

Each time a news is appearing on the website, it could be also sent by email. To enable this feature, it is necessary to define a <ANNOUNCE/> tag in the configuration file:

<ANNOUNCE email="<annoucement_email>" format="html|text" />

=head2 Array Definitions

It is possible to define arrays for AWebGen. Some of them are already known by AWebGen, the other could be directly used in your website skeleton files. Arrays must be defined as following (here each value are pushed at the end of the referenced array):

<ARRAYS>
	<ARRAY name="..." profile="...">
		value
	</ARRAY>
	<ARRAYS name="...">
		value
	</ARRAYS>
</ARRAYS>

=head2 Hash Definitions

It is possible to define hash tables for AWebGen. Some of them are already known by AWebGen, the other could be directly used in your website skeleton files. Hashtables must be defined as following:

<HASHS>
	<HASH name="..." profile="...">
		<PAIR key="...">...</PAIR>
		<PAIR key="...">...</PAIR>
	</HASH>
	<HASH name="...">
		<PAIR key="...">...</PAIR>
		<PAIR key="...">...</PAIR>
	</HASH>
</HASHS>

=head1 MODEL FILES

AWebGen uses existing HTML files from the current directory as the files to generate. Theses files could include a model file which must be located in the directory "${ROOT}/.awebgen/include". These files are complete or part of HTML files.

For each file (.html, .php, .asp...) AWebGen parses them and replaces macro commands by the associated values.
The supported macro commands are:

=over 4

=item ${BEGIN:I<shtml_name>}

Several HTML entities are directly expanded by AWebGen because they do not correspond to standard HTML but are provided by AWebGen for convenience because they have a specified semantic for AWebGen:

=over 4

=item "&obrace;" is expanded to "{"

=item "&ehtmlcomment;" is expanded to "-->"

=back

=head1 DATABASE FILES

=head2 Database File Format

Several files are assumed to be databases in which a lot of data could be put and used by AWebGen.
A database file is a text file in which each database entry is separated by a line with only the
character "." on it.
Each database entry is composed of fields. A field is defined by a field name and a value according
to the syntax: NAME=VALUE. The VALUE could be written on several lines.

The dabase file are supposed to be in the directory "config_path/db".

=head2 Standard Databases

Several standard database files are directly supported by AWebGen.

=over 4

=item B<news.txt> contains the news of the website. The supported fields are "DATE", "TITLE", "TEXT" and "LINK" (optional).
The name of the news database is given by the constant NEWS_DB (by default "news").

=back

=head1 AUTOSCRIPTS

A set of PHP scripts are embedded inside the AWebGen distribution. They could be directly put in the root directory of the generated website.

=over 4

=item B<index.php>

A file B<index.php> which is redirecting to the root page is generated in each directory without index file.

=item B<ml.php>

The file B<ml.php> permits to manage several mailing lists in a user point of view. This is generated only of a entry
named "mailinglists" was defined in the configuration hash tables (see "configuration file" section).
This hash table should map the mailing list identifiers as keys and the mailing list addresses as values.
Additionally, an hash table named "mailinglist-comments" could be defined to map the mailing list identifiers
to the textual descriptions of the mailing lists.

To work properly, two constants must be defined: ML_ADDRESS and ML_REQUEST_ADDRESS. Both are email address pattern in which the string
"${NAME}" will be replaced by the identifier of the mailing list. The ML_ADDRESS constant represents the posting email address to the
mailing list, and the ML_REQUEST_ADDRESS represents the register/unregister email address to the mailing list.

The B<ml.php> script displayes a page on which it is possible to register/unregister an email to/from a mailing. The "fullpage.shtml" file style is assumed to provide the HTML page skeleton.

=item B<redirect.php>

The file B<redirect.php> is generating at the website root. It permits to display a redirection message to a given url (specified with the HTML GET parameter named "url"). The displayed page is based on the model file "fullpage.shtml" (see "model files" section).

=item B<sendmessage.php>

The file B<sendmessage.php> permits to send emails. It is generated only when the constant
GENERATE_SEND_MESSAGE_SCRIPT is set to "true". This script provides a contact formular with
a security image to prevent robots to send emails.

The B<sendmessage.php> script displayes a page on which it is possible to fill the contact formular. The "fullpage.shtml" file style is assumed to provide the HTML page skeleton.

=item B<snap.php>

The file B<snap.php> permits to be redirected to a download page of software snapshots. It takes as several GET parameters

=over 6

=item the "project" name and optionally the "subproject" name. The snapshot URL is assumed to be defined in SNAP_URL and SNAP_URL_SUBPROJECT depending if the subproject name was given;

=item the Maven "groupId" and Maven "artifactId". The snapshot URL is supposed to be given by the MAVEN_REPOSITY constant followed by the group identifier and the artifact identifier. If the GET parameter "version" is specified, the string "version-SNAPSHOT" will be merge to the target location. In case the PHP
script is requiring to explore the Maven repository, you must fill the constant MAVEN_REPOSITORY_DIR with
the local path to the Maven repository root;

=item the "directory" name of the project and the "subproject" name. The snapshot URL is assumed to be defined by "flet/directory/subproject" or by "flet/directory" where "flet" is the first letter of the "directory".

=back 

The constant SNAP_URL must be defined as the redirection url when only a project name is given. The constant SNAP_URL_SUBPROJECT must be defined as the redirection url when both a project and subproject names are given. If the SNAP_URL_SUBPROJECT is not defined, it is assumed to be the same as SNAP_URL. The macro commands "${FLET}", "${NAME}" and "${SUBNAME}" could appear in the URL ("${SUBNAME}" only for SNAP_URL_SUBPROJECT). They will be replaced by the first letter of the project name, the project and the subproject name respectively.

=item B<spip.php>

The file B<spip.php> permits compatibility with a previous version of the website written with the SPIP content management system.
The B<spip.php> file is generated only if a database file named "spip.txt" was defined (see "database files" section). The database file supports the following entries:

=over 6

=item if PAGE_ID is defined it means that the entry if a standard page redirection. The spip page identifier must be put in PAGE_ID field, the target url must be put in TARGET field and optionally the COMMENT field could be defined;

=item if AUTHOR_ID is defined it means that the entry if an author page redirection. The spip author identifier must be put in AUTHOR_ID field, the target url must be put in TARGET field and optionally the COMMENT field could be defined;

=item if ERROR_PAGE is defined it means that the entry extends the message displayed my the "spip.php" page in case of error.

=back

If the file was generated other files that are correspondiong to oldest SPIP version are also generated: article.php, article.php3,
rubrique.php, rubrique.php3, auteur.php, and auteur.php3.

=item B<websvn.php>

The file B<websvn.php> permits to be redirected to a WebSVN page. It takes as GET parameter the "project" name and the "subproject" name.
The redirection URL is specified in the WEBSVN_URL and WEBSVN_FULL_URL constants in the configuration files (see "configuration file" section). Eahc of these constants could contain the strings "${PROJECT}" or "${SUBPROJECT}" which will be replaced by the name of the project and the subproject respectively. The WEBSVN_URL is assumed to be the URL to access to the SVN with a project name only, and the WEBSVN_FULL_URL is assumed to be the URL to access to the SVN with both project and a subproject names.

=back
